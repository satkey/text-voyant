Pixelating: A Digital Humanities Mixer - Text Analysis using Voyant Tools
The Pixelating Mixer is an opportunity for DH scholars across campus to meet colleagues, talk tools, brainstorm ideas and network with others who use digital tools to explore and visualize their research.In this session, we'll look at Text Analysis using Voyant Tools. Voyant is a text reading and analysis environment for digital texts that lets you dive in and do some light analysis of texts without needing to code. We'll introduce the core ideas of text mining and provide some hands-on instruction in text analysis, utilizing a user-friendly, web-based tool.
